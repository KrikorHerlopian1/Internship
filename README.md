# Internship Assignment

I used glide library, in order to load images.

I used the library recycler view , to display lists.

I used the library swipetorefreshlayout, in order for user to refresh main screen if he wants to with new data 

I used  the library retrofit, a Type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java. To make API Calls.

I used 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.6.0' and 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.6'.  A Converter which uses Gson for serialization to and from JSON. It made it easy for me to map the results from API Calls straight into my data models, rather than taking lengthy time of parsing the JSON by myself.
